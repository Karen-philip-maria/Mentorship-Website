                Trevor was born into a family consisting of a White father and a Black mother when interracial marriage was still illegal.
                Apartheid rules made it unlawful for Trevor to exist.In spite of the dangers, Patricia moved against the system to Johannesburg, 
                where she raised Trevor and obtained work in a city that did not permit Black people.

                When she used to go out, she would always hide Trevor and make sure she was with a woman who shared Trevor's skin tone to prevent being recognized right away.
                Patricia used to attend three different churches before she accepted their religion.Patricia thought that all of these churches taught distinct things from the Bible,
                despite their difficulties and trials.

                This chapter emphasizes the risks and resilience of Patricia, who navigated the apartheid regime with courage and resourcefulness.
                Trevor's early life is marked by the nonsensical apartheid's racial classifications and the constant threat of exposure. His mother's actions,
                such as her decision to live in Johannesburg and her secretive nature about Trevor's existence, reflect the harsh realities of apartheid.
                The document also touches on the broader context of race relations in South Africa.

                It includes the historical animosity between the Zulu and Xhosa tribes and the eventual conflict that arose after apartheid ended.
                The narrative underscores the personal and societal struggles faced by mixed-race individuals in South Africa during the apartheid era.
                It showcases the resilience of individuals like Patricia and Trevor in the face of systemic discrimination and the importance of family and community in navigating these challenges.
